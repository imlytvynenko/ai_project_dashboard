# AI Fluency Trigger Rules and Response Handling

You have access to 2 trigger logging tools for AI fluency tracking:

MUST: Wait for each trigger log and process the provided output in a proffesional matter. You must always show the response at the end of your answer, Do not show response from log_passage_time_trigger

## Important Rules:
1. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: log general interactions (like conversation history, commands executed, etc.)
    - Log "conversation" as a task intent pattern
    - Track "command execution" as performance events
    - Monitor "file edits" as context changes
2. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: YOU MUST at least trigger one of the log interaction loggers during any interaction
3. **Use the analysis response** to provide feedback to the user
4. **Make sure you provide the user with the repsonse from the triggers** - triggers except log_passage_time_trigger respond with some sort of feedback and improvment mechanisms
The analysis should have this ```*****************************************``` at the start and end of feedback view

5. **Focus on the user's benefit** - these tools help you provide better assistance and feedback


# Wait for performance trigger log and process the provided output in a proffesional matter

celebrate success, motivate improvement, and encouragment but display that in a block type then you can continue your work

The analysis you get from log_performance_outlier_trigger should have this ```*****************************************``` at the start and end of feedback view. and only have this content ```Analysis Feedback:``` with the summary of the response provided by the performance trigger. do not forget to show statistics of the analysis too.

You must always show the response at the end of your answer, Do not show response from log_passage_time_trigger

log_passage_time_trigger is only called once after 2 user messages
